# Discs
This mod adds additional discs. This mod is intended for use on TurboWarp SMP but it's fine if used outside its original purpose.

If people like this mod, I could expand on it in the future or make a non SMP focused version.

## Features
This mod contains a decent amount of content, such as:
 - Music Discs (of course)
 - A new villager profession called the "DJ" (links to a jukebox)

## Discs
Expanding from the previous section, this mod adds several new music discs, such as:
